# SpaceX-Interplanetary-Transportation-System-by-Thrimm-Aerospace
A recreation of the SpaceX massive system from Elon Musk presentation.

OVERVIEW:
This mod is an attempt at recreating the reusable space transportation system proposed by SpaceX and Elon Musk
in September 2016. A great deal of work has been put into making the parts as realistic and as close to the original
SpaceX concept as possible. As such, it is probably vastly overpowered for stock KSP, while the ultimate application
is Real Solar System with Realism Overhaul installed.

Your adventure as future Mars colonist begins today.

FEATURES:
- Crew Ship with 4 crew and 100 passenger capacity.
- Tanker Ship for orbital refueling.
- Reusable Booster with attachable fins and gridfins. Built-in decoupler, probe core and antenna.
- Dedicated shielded side docking port. Matches stock senior docking port.
- Raptor engines for atmospheric and vacuum use.
- Unbreakable landing legs.
- Solar Panels, RCS etc.

CHANGELOG:
v 0.91	Tweaked the Raptor Sea-level engine to have correct thrust at sea level. Further config tweaks.
	A backwards compatibility version for KSP 1.1.3 is now also available, with config files for Real Plume and Smoke Screen.
	WIP config files for RealFuels (some engine Isps are off, but the ship gets into orbit just fine)
v 0.9	Initial release.
v 0.6	(closed) Adjusted config values for gridfins, booster fins and ship landing legs. Lift values are
now closer to stock values.
v 0.5	(closed) Massive texture overhaul for majority of the parts. Further reworked some models.
v 0.4	(closed) Reworked most of the models. Ship landing legs are now three separate parts. Their textures
have been redone.
v 0.3	(closed) Added side docking port. It matches stock senior docking port, allowing you to refuel
your transport in orbit and dock stock vessels to it as well.
v 0.2	(closed) Added missing parts such as RCS, solar panels and vacuum engines.
v 0.1	Initial public pre-release.
